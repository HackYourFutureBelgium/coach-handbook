# Coach HandBook


Hello coach.  This is (hopefully) everything you need to know to get started with us at HYF.

## Module Coaches


The two repositories you will need.

### Class Repository

This is your entry point for preparing class and reviewing homework.   You can look through the class-6 [repository](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/class-6), [wiki](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/class-6/wiki) and [homework review app](https://hackyourfuturebelgium.github.io/class-6) to get an idea of what to expect.

The important pieces are:

__Class Wiki__:


This is where you will find links to everything you'll need (you can also find a link to this repository in the description of the class Slack channel):
* _Module Repository_: This will contain all the module projects & exercises, lesson plans & class resources. More about this below.
* _Homework Submission Boards_: You and the students will keep track of their progress through the weekly assignments using issues and a project board in their class repository.
* _Weekly Questions_: In each module's Shared Notes page on the wiki, students will post questions they have over the week.  This is helpful for preparing the next Sunday's review.
* _The Class History_: You'll also find links to all of the previous materials the students have studied, and the coaches they have had.  Please reach out to past coaches!

__Class Code__:

In the code tab of the class repository you will find three things:
* Student Bios:  Their first assignment in module zero is to send a PR to the class repository containing their photo, name and some background info.  It's helpful to put a face to their names before the first Sunday.
* Attendance: There is a markdown file for taking attendance each Sunday.
* Class App Source Code: Here you can add or remove students and mark the class's progress through HYF Be by directly modifying the .js files in the ```class-data``` directory.

__Class App__:

This is a simple website for finding and reviewing student's homeworks, past and present.  You can search by module or student, and access their live projects or source code directly on github.

### Module Repository

There is one repository containing all the materials necessary to study or teach that module.  There are two important parts to each module:


__Wiki__:

The wiki contains all of the study and lesson materials for each module. This includes lesson plans, pre-class readings, learning objectives, and extra helpful resources.  This is a wiki for a reason, please feel free to update the readings and lesson plans!  Adding links to helpful examples & resources, or modifying lesson plans to reflect student needs is more than welcome.

About lecture slides: You'll find links to past slide shows, you're welcome to use them or to write your own.  All we ask is that if you write your own you include them in the wiki for future coaches!

__Code__:

The main README for each module repository will describe which tutorials are assigned as weekly projects, and recommend which exercises to accompany each project.

Weekly projects will all be based off of video tutorials.  Students will be expected to follow the tutorials, breaking the code into steps and developing each step on a new branch.  Depending on the week some projects will ask the students to add a feature from their imagination after completing the tutorial.

Module exercises are not strictly required but are recommended.  They provide further practice on the sub-skills necessary to complete the project, allowing students to zero in on those skills without needing to stay aware of the entire project.  These exercises will sometimes be hosted directly in the module repository, and will sometimes be stand-alone repositories.  Each week's project will specify, and the class app will also help you to find their exercise repositories.

## Homework Coaches

As a homework coach, you'll be helping the Module Coaches to give code reviews for the students' weekly assignments.    The most important repository for you will be the Class Repository.  This is where you'll find the project board for tracking student progress, and the class app for easy access to all student homeworks.  You can leave more general feedback in their weekly issue on the class repository, more specific feedback can be left as issues tied to lines of code in their homework repos.  To learn more about the homework submission process, check out [the homework submission repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission).

Do keep an eye out for cheating!  Because of the open-ness of these assignments, it is very easy for students to copy each others' work.  But it's also easy for you to catch them ;)  If you see suspicious similarities just check in with the students. As long as they are aware and have been working together, it's not a problem.

## Review Coaches

As a review coach, your work is the simplest.  Just join us on Sunday mornings!

Students from all classes start coming in around 9:30 to study together before class starts at 12.  You just need to hang out and answer questions, or run little code-alongs if you find multiple students are stuck on the same questions.  If you'd like to take it the extra mile, you can get in touch with students the week before to find some common confusions and come in prepared to run a session on that topic.

While you don't have to officially check in with us to help out on a Sunday Morning, it is helpful if you at least let us know the week before so can let the students know what they can expect each Sunday.
